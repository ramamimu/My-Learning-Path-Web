                <p> Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, (born June 25, 1936, Parepare, Indonesia—died September 11, 2019,
                    Jakarta), Indonesian aircraft engineer and politician who was president of Indonesia (1998–99) and a
                    leader in the country’s technological and economic development in the late 20th and early 21st
                    centuries. </p>
                <p>Brilliant in science and mathematics from childhood, Habibie received his postsecondary education at
                    the Bandung Institute of Technology in Bandung, Indonesia, and furthered his studies at the
                    Institute of Technology of North Rhine–Westphalia in Aachen, West Germany. After graduating in 1960,
                    he remained in West Germany as an aeronautics researcher and production supervisor. </p>
                <p>Suharto took power as Indonesia’s second president in 1966, and in 1974 he asked Habibie—whom he had
                    known for 25 years—to return to the country to help build advanced industries. Suharto assured him
                    that he could do whatever was needed to accomplish that goal. Initially assigned to the state oil
                    company, Pertamina, Habibie became a government adviser and chief of a new aerospace company in
                    1976. Two years later he became research minister and head of the Agency for Technology Evaluation
                    and Application. In these roles he oversaw a number of ventures involving the production and
                    transportation of heavy machinery, steel, electronics and telecommunications equipment, and arms and
                    ammunition.</p>
                <p>Habibie believed his enterprises ultimately would spawn high-tech ventures in the private sector and
                    allow the country to climb the technology ladder. In 1993 he unveiled the first Indonesian-developed
                    plane, which he helped design, and in the following year he launched a plan to refurbish more than
                    three dozen vessels bought from the former East German navy at his initiative. The Finance Ministry
                    balked at the cost of the latter endeavour, while the armed forces thought that its turf had been
                    violated. Nevertheless, Habibie got more than $400 million for refurbishing. </p>
